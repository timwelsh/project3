### Team 2 - Sherry C., Thomas Erickson, Wes Hatley, Julie Ragsdale, Tim Welsh

### Name: Trip Stirring

Idea: Trip Stirring is a Chrome extension that will display an image when a tab is opened. The images are based on input where the user selects country and/or city names of either destinations they have planned or destinations they would like to go to one day, a bucketlist.

TripStirring.com is the site where a user will get information on the extension, the pricing and will be provided a Get button that will direct them to the Chrome Web Store where the extension can be installed.
